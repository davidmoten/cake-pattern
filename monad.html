Monads in scala.

Monads are formally defined in a branch of mathematics called Category Theory and correspond to a useful functional design pattern in scala. This article aims to describe the formal definition and the relationship to scala.

We firstly define Category, Functor, Natural Transformation and Monad.

a Category C is 

 * a set of objects obj(C)
 * a set of morphisms hom(C) which are relations between objects
 * a composition operator * for morphisms

The constraints on a category are:

 * every object has an identity morphism
 * the composition operator is associative

A Functor from Category A to Category B (A->B)

 * relates objects in A to objects in B
 * relates morphisms in A to morphisms in B

A Functor also

 * preserves identity morphisms
 * preserves composition of morphisms

Note that for category A there is an obvious identity functor 1A:A->A

A Natural Transformation mu

 * relates two functors F,G on A->B
 * relates each object a in A to a morphism mu(a): F(a)->G(a) in category B such that 
for every morphism f:a->a' in A we have mu(a') * F(f) = G(f) * mu(a) (commutativity).

a Monad has

 * a functor F from Category A to Category A (endomorphic functor) 
 * a natural transformation nu:1A->F
 * a natural transformation mu:FxF->F
 * mu is associative with F (mu * Fmu = mu * muF)
 * nu is the effective inverse of m  (mu * Fnu = mu * nuF = 1F)

Category: objects = Scala Types (Int,String,List[String],..), morphisms = functions between types
Functor: ToList: Types -> Types given by ToList(T)=List[T], maps morphisms obviously
Monad: functor=ToList, nu=T->List[T],mu=List[T]xList[T]=>concatenation
